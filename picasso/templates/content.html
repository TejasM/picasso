    <h1>General Guidelines</h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        Picasso allows users to contribute different kinds of content, including reviews, photos, events, votes,
        tips,
        private messages, and more. Playing nice
        isn't rocket science, but just in case, we've put together these general guidelines. Please also read the
        guidelines below for specific types of content
        that you might contribute to the site.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h2>Inappropriate content</h2>
            Colorful language and imagery is fine, but there's no need for threats, harassment, lewdness, hate
            speech, and other displays of bigotry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h2>Conflicts of interest</h2>
            Your contributions should be unbiased and objective. For example, you shouldn’t write reviews of your
            own business or employer, your friends’ or
            relatives’ business, your peers or competitors in your industry, or businesses in your networking group.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h2>Promotional content</h2>
            Unless you're using your Business Owners Account to add content to your business's profile page, we
            generally frown upon promotional content.
            Let's keep the site useful for consumers and not overrun with commercial noise from every user.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h2>Relevance</h2>
            Please make sure your contributions are relevant and appropriate to the forum. For example, reviews
            aren't the place for rants about a business's
            employment practices, political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't
            address the core of the consumer experience.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            Don't publicize other people's private information. Please don't post close-up photos of other people
            without their permission, and please don't
            post other people's full names unless you're referring to service providers who are commonly identified
            by their full names.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
            Don't swipe content from other sites or users. You're a smart cookie, so write your own reviews and
            take your own photos, please!
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h2>Additional Guidelines</h2>
    </p>
    <ul>

            <p>

            <h3>Review Guidelines</h3>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The best reviews are passionate and personal. They offer a rich narrative, a wealth of detail, and a helpful
        tip
        or two for other consumers. Here are some
        additional thoughts for conscientious reviewers.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>

                <h4>Personal experience</h4>
                We want to hear about your firsthand consumer experience, not what you heard from your co-worker
                or significant other. Try to tell your own
                story without resorting to broad generalizations and conclusory allegations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                <h4>Accuracy</h4>
                Make sure your review is factually correct. Feel free to air your opinions, but don't exaggerate
                or misrepresent your experience. We don't
                take sides when it comes to factual disputes, so we expect you to stand behind your review.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                <h4>Review updates</h4>
                Review updates should reflect a new experience or interaction with the business. Don't tell the
                same old story you've already told. If you'd
                like to add new insight to an old experience, just edit your review instead of creating a new
                update.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h3>Photo and Video Guidelines</h3>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Business photos and videos should be broadly relevant to the business and reflect the typical consumer
        experience (e.g., what the business looks like, what
        the business offers, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
        We may remove photos and videos that showcase a more unique personal experience (e.g., your smiling group of
        friends at the bar, the fly in your soup) as
        well as lower quality photos and videos (e.g., too blurry or dark).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h3>User Profile Guidelines</h3>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Don't be shy — use your account profile to let people know who you are and what makes you tick. Users want
        to
        read reviews from people they know and trust
        (not those with profiles that are empty or laced with inappropriate content).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>

            <h3>Business Owner Guidelines</h3>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h4>Business owners should be getting in on the act, too. Some words of wisdom:</h4>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>

                <h4>About Your Business</h4>
                You can use the "About This Business" tab to tell people a little something special about your
                business. Please keep it relevant: don't use
                this feature to attack your competitors, reviewers, or Picasso, and don't use it to seed keywords or
                post special offers or promotions — we'll
                remove them if we see them.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                <h4>Public Comments</h4>
                Private messaging is often the best way to resolve a dispute with an unhappy customer, but
                business owners can also address issues publicly
                by posting a public comment. As with private messaging, we ask that business owners upload a clear
                photo of themselves to help personalize
                their message. Don't use public comments to launch personal attacks, advertise, or offer an
                incentive to change a review.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                <h4>Video</h4>
                Videos are a great way for advertisers to promote themselves on Picasso. Be as creative as you
                can, but please keep it clean. We're not big
                fans of imagery showing violence, drug use, nudity, near nudity, or suggestive acts. Also, please
                don't use your video to disparage other
                businesses, users or Picasso; request or solicit reviews from users; or respond to user reviews.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                <h4>Don't ask customers for reviews</h4>
                Don't ask your students to review you or your business on Picasso. Over time, solicited reviews
                create bias in your business listing — a bias
                that savvy consumers can smell from a mile away.
