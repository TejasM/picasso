    </p>
    <p>
        Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account if you include personal information
        in the content you post publicly. You can
        reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Site pseudonymously, though doing so could detract
        from the credibility of your contributions
        to the Site. Users can also use the Member Search feature to find one another based on their names or email
        addresses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Site are only private to the extent that both
        you and the sender/recipient keep them
        private. For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your messages publicly posts
        it or its contents. Similarly, Picasso may
        also access such messages in the course of investigations relating to Site use.

    <h3 id="data-retention"><strong>5. Data Retention and Account Termination</strong></h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can close your account by contacting us. We will remove your public posts from view and/or dissociate them
        from your account profile, but we may retain
        information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For
        example, we may retain information to prevent,
        investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site or to comply with legal obligations.
        Please note that businesses cannot remove
        their business listings, ratings or reviews by closing their accounts.

    <h3 id="children"><strong>6. Children</strong></h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Site is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children under
        13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please
        contact us. If we become aware that a child
        under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such
        information and terminate the child's account.

    <h3 id="security"><strong>7. Security</strong></h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
        transmission and once we receive it.
        However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is
        100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to
        use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
        security.
