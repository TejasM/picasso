                        to confer rights or remedies upon any third
                        party.

                        The Terms contain the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site, and
                        supersede any prior agreement between you and
                        us on such subject matter. The parties acknowledge that no reliance is placed on any
                        representation made but not expressly contained in
                        these Terms.

                        Any failure on Picasso's part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms does
                        not constitute a waiver of such right or
                        provision. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein
                        shall not be deemed a waiver of any further
                        rights hereunder.

                        If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, then only that provision
                        shall be modified to reflect the parties'
                        intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain
                        in full force and effect and enforceable.

                        written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us without restriction. Any attempted
                        assignment by you shall violate these Terms
                        and be void.
